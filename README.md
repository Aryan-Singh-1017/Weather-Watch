## Project Overview

Weather Watch is a weather tracking web app that allows users to search for the weather of a specific city. It provides information about temperature, humidity, wind speed, and displays an appropriate weather icon. The app is designed with a clean and intuitive user interface.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into three main components:

- **HTML File**: The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the structure of the web app. It includes the search bar, weather information display, and placeholders for weather icons.

- **CSS Styling**: The CSS file (`style.css`) defines the styling and layout of the web app. It specifies the color scheme, fonts, alignment, and responsive design. It is responsible for making the app visually appealing.

- **JavaScript Code**: The JavaScript code embedded within the HTML file is responsible for fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and updating the user interface with the retrieved information.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Weather Watch web app, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-watch.git
   ```

2. **API Key**: You will need to obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch weather data. Once you have your API key, replace the placeholder `"YOUR_API_KEY"` in the JavaScript code in the HTML file with your actual API key.

3. **Open the Web App**:
   Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start using the Weather Watch web app.

## Usage

1. **Search for Weather**:
   - In the web app, you'll see a search bar where you can enter the name of a city.
   - After entering the city name, click the search button.

2. **View Weather Information**:
   - Once you search for a city, the app will fetch real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
   - The weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an appropriate weather icon, will be displayed on the screen.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If you enter an invalid city name or if there are issues with the API request, an error message will be displayed on the screen.

4. **Enjoy Weather Updates**: Stay informed about the current weather conditions for any city you want to explore.
